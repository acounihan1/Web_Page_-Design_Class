    	   			<p class="stop">Alice Paul was a major figure in the United States Woman Suffrage 
    	   			 Movement. Alice was raised was raised to believe in gender equality by
    	   			 her mother, who was a member of a suffrage group when Alice was 
    	   			 younger.</p>
    	   			 <p>lice first became interested in becoming an active 
    	   			 suffragist when she went to England. She took part in a campaign 
    	   			 that smashed windows and went on hunger strikes in prisons to raise 
    	   			 awareness to the issue.</p> 
    	   			 <p>When she returned to the US she joined a suffrage group and was soon 
    	   			 appointed head. They organised a parade and were attacked by men 
    	   			 while police watched. She then focused on getting the presidentâ€™s 
    	   			 attention and vote. They were arrested and treated terribly. The 
    	   			 news of the prison conditions came out and caused many people to 
    	   			 support women's suffrage.</p>
    	   			 <p>On August 24, 1920, Alice's goal was achieved when the 19th Amendment 
    	   			 was ratified and women finally had the right to vote. Alice Paul 
    	   			 continued to fight for completely equal treatment for women and men 
    	   			 for the rest of her life.</p>
