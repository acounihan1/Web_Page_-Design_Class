		<h2>The History of the Cuban Club</h2>
			<p>There have been several deaths in the building. Because of this, the club has 
			earned the nickname "Club Dead." An actor committed suicide by jumping off the 
			stage. An enraged board member shot another board member in the face after a 
			fight. A woman in a white dress and red high heels stalks the staircases. A 
			little boy, Jimmy, drowned in the pool. Their restless spirits still haunt the 
			building. Jimmy plays with balls people bring for him and has been known to 
			mischievously tug on people's shirts. A few lucky people can hear Jimmy whisper 
			to him. Also, sometimes the spirits communicate through flickers in 
			flashlights. <a href="http://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/post/tour-haunted-cuban-
